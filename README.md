# siteUpdater

siteUpdater is a C++ based post editor for my personal website, stevenan.com

  - Implemented from the ground up text editor using Linked Lists
  - Each node holds a line of code of HTML
  - Adds posts automatically and shifts lines down whenever necessary

>>Hoping to add FTP upload/download to save even more trouble in the future
